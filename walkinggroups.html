                <p style="">Shire Nomads run a free walking programme for
                    those over 55 who want to meet likeminded people along with getting
                    fitter through walking. The walks are up to 5 miles long and can last
                    up to 3 hours, they include a mixture of town and countryside routes
                    and are aimed at more advanced walkers. </p>
