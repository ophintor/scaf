            <h3>Backgound</h3><p>In 2001 Bristol City Council awarded Shirehampton Public Hall Community Association Â£5000 to develop an environmental project in Shirehampton from its Sustainable Neighbourhoods Fund. Various ideas were examined and then Arthur Barker described his vision for a community park, to be sited on the Daisy Field. Various people came together early in 2002 to discuss and consult on this plan, and Shirehampton Greens was born. Plans for the park were presented to a full SCAF Meeting by Arthur, as a second stage of consultation and were favourably received. Shirehampton Greens was adopted on 26 March 2002 as an Action Group under SCAF's umbrella.</p>
            <h3>Aims & Objectives</h3><p>These are encapsulated in our Vision, which is for a community park serving everyone in the community. The Daisy Field and the adjacent allotments are the starting point for this evolving project. Input from everyone in Shire will be invited and plans will be in keeping with the Council's designation of the site as a green open space.</p>
