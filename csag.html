                We work in close partnership with the Police and other statutory agencies as well as a whole host of other local organisations and local residents. Our Community Safety group is charied by our local Beat Manager, PC Amanada Patterson, and between us this group sets the PACT (Partners and Communities Together) for Shirehampton. The current PACT priority is anti-social behaviour in a number of hot-spot areas. Other key areas of work include:
                <ul type="square"><br>
                <li>Regular 'walkabout' in an area of Shirehampton with Bristol City Council Officers from Street Cleansing, Highways, Parks, Parking Services etc. - we take a log of everything e.g. street lights not working, litter, fly tipping, graffiti, potholes, uneven pavements, health & safety issues, road signage issues, dog fouling and local transport issues. We work with our partnets to put it right!</li>
                <li>Work on domestic abuse issues with local partners. We also support & contribute to North Bristol Domestic Abuse Forum (NBDAF)</li>
                <li>Licensing enforcement - alcohol related crime & incidents are a significant issue in Shirehampton</li>
                <li>Road safety issues - including facilitating traffic & road work public consultations</li>
                <li>Community safety education programmes with Police & Avon Fire Bridage</li>
                <li>Tackle significant parking issues in and around Shire High Street and local schools</li>
                <li>Organise community clean up campaigns & events - promotion of recycling, reduction of litter etc.
                <h3>Aims & Objectives </h3><ul type="square">
                <li>To coordinate a strategic, multi-agency approach which seeks to address all relevant, agency based issues that have a direct or indirect affect on community safety.</li>
                <li>To facilitate targeting of young people at risk of offending, at risk of family breakdown or "children in need" </li>

                <li>To identify community work programmes that rehabilitates offenders and improves the environment to the benefit of the community at large. </li>
                <li>To coordinate the agencies and voluntary groups on the area in order that a structured programme is in place to support strong bids for funding. </li>
                <li>To consult with the public in order to identify the needs of the community. </li>
                <li>To undertake a programme of education around issues of target hardening and crime prevention without significantly increasing the fear of crime especially among elderly residents. </li></ul></div></div></div>
