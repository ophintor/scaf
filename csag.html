                <h2>Community Safety Action Groups</h2>
                We work in close partnership with the Police and other statutory agencies as well as a whole host of
                other local organisations and local residents. Our Community Safety group is charied by our local Beat
                Manager, PC Amanada Patterson, and between us this group sets the PACT (Partners and Communities
                Together) for Shirehampton. The current PACT priority is anti-social behaviour in a number of hot-spot
                areas. Other key areas of work include:
