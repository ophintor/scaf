                        <strong>The overall aim of SCAF is to improve the quality of life for everyone living and
                            working in Shirehampton.</strong><br />
                        As a charity the Shirehampton Community Action Forum takes pride in helping improve the area of
                        Shirehampton for all those who work and live there. We accomplish this by various different
                        groups and projects, however our most recent and major project is being a lead partner within
                        the Shire Community Plan.

                    <h3>Shire Door to Door Shopping Trips</h3>
                    <p>
                        Aside from the new Community Plan for Shirehampton, we also organise <strong>free</strong>
                        weekly door to door shopping/social trips to a variety of supermarkets/shopping centres
                        especially for Shire residents aged 60+ in a fully accessible minibus. We also put on longer
                        “special” trips and this year we have had extended visits in the spring and summer to
                        Weston-Super-Mare, Abergavenny and Burnham on Sea. In early December we also run special trips
                        to Cadbury Garden Centre.
