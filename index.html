                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>Shirehampton Community Action Forum (SCAF) is a small,
                    grass-roots community organisation working in Shirehampton, North West
                    Bristol within the Avonmouth ward and about 6,800 residents.
                    Shirehampton is on the outskirts of Bristol and is approximately 6
                    miles from the city centre - it is semi-rural and does not benefit from
                    many of the facilities and resources afforded by other more central
                    neighbourhoods.<br>
                    <br>
                    Shirehampton has been a recognised both as a 'pocket of deprivation',
                    and as a disadvantaged community particularly on the grounds of social
                    and economic deprivation, high crime, poor health, low educational
                    achievement and lackign community facilities and amenities.<br>
                    <br>
                    We are a registered charity and not for profit Company Limited by
                    Guarantee. We have been working for the benefit of everyone in our
                    local community since 2001. The Forum and action group have created
                    strong and effective working partnerships. These have involved BCC,
                    statuatory agencies, community groups, voluntary sector organisations,
                    schools, churches and our local councillors. We work extensively in
                    areas like community safety, planning and development, and also about
                    the environment. We also deliver much of the agenda of the
                    Neighbourhood Partnership for Shirehampton through our Community Safety
                    Action Group and Full Forum Meetings.</p>

                <h3>Full Forum Meetings</h3>
                <p>We
                    hold 5 Full Forums meetings each year. These are an opportunity to hear
                    about SCAF's wide range of work and projects, updates from the action
                    groups, exchange information and bring up any community issues you are
                    concerned about. We often have guest presentations e.g about a Shire
                    Flood Plan or from Agents/developers on a major building/development
                    project in Shire. All our meetings are held in the main Hall at Shire
                    Public Hall, which is fully accessible and everyone is welcome. </p>

                <h3>Community Safety Group Meetings</h3>
                We work in close partnership with the Police and other statutory
                agencies as well as a whole host of other local organisations and local
                residents. Our Community Safety Action Group is chaired by our local
                Beat Manager, PC Amanda Patterson and between us this group sets PACT
                (Partners And Communities Together) for Shirehampton. The current PACT
                is anti-social behaviour in a number of hot-spot areas.
