<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Shirehampton Community Action Forum (SCAF) is a small,
grass-roots community organisation working in Shirehampton, North West
Bristol within the Avonmouth ward and about 6,800 residents.
Shirehampton is on the outskirts of Bristol and is approximately 6
miles from the city centre - it is semi-rural and does not benefit from
many of the facilities and resources afforded by other more central
neighbourhoods.<br>
<br>
Shirehampton has been a recognised both as a 'pocket of deprivation',
and as a disadvantaged community particularly on the grounds of social
and economic deprivation, high crime, poor health, low educational
achievement and lackign community facilities and amenities.<br>
<br>
We are a registered charity and not for profit Company Limited by
Guarantee. We have been working for the benefit of everyone in our
local community since 2001. The Forum and action group have created
strong and effective working partnerships. These have involved BCC,
statuatory agencies, community groups, voluntary sector organisations,
schools, churches and our local councillors. We work extensively in
areas like community safety, planning and development, and also about
the environment. We also deliver much of the agenda of the
Neighbourhood Partnership for Shirehampton through our Community Safety
Action Group and Full Forum Meetings.</p>

<h2>What We Do</h2>
</div>
<div class="col-sm-8">
<h3>Full Forum Meetings</h3>
<p>We
hold 5 Full Forums meetings each year. These are an opportunity to hear
about SCAF's wide range of work and projects, updates from the action
groups, exchange information and bring up any community issues you are
concerned about. We often have guest presentations e.g about a Shire
Flood Plan or from Agents/developers on a major building/development
project in Shire. All our meetings are held in the main Hall at Shire
Public Hall, which is fully accessible and everyone is welcome. </p>

<h3>Community Safety Group Meetings</h3>
We work in close partnership with the Police and other statutory
agencies as well as a whole host of other local organisations and local
residents. Our Community Safety Action Group is chaired by our local
Beat Manager, PC Amanda Patterson and between us this group sets PACT
(Partners And Communities Together) for Shirehampton. The current PACT
is anti-social behaviour in a number of hot-spot areas.
