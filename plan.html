                        <li>Identifies local problems &amp; opportunities</li>
                        <li>Sets out an achievable and long term vision for the future</li>
                        <li>Prepares a plan of action to achieve this vision</li>
                    </ul>

                    The views of all of the community were gathered through a comprehensive
                    survey &amp; community participation/consultation events. The plan
                    involves looking at all aspects of living and/or working in a community
                    and&nbsp;has sections on community safety, heath, traffic and
                    transport, community facilities/buildings, housing &amp; planning,
                    parks and green spaces, employment and enterprise etc. It can include
                    everything we think is relevant in Shire and we can decide what's
                    important to us!<br>
                    <b>Who did it?</b> This was a partnership project led by
                    local residents, Shire Community Action Forum (SCAF) and Cotswold
                    Community Association.
